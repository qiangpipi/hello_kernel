####Hello kernel####
It's a sample for kernel coding.

####Precondition####
Ya, you will need kernel source code to proceed.
1. Go to [www.kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/) to download one.
2. Build the kernel tree
```
sudo make oldconfig (or make menuconfig)
make
make modules
make modules_install
make install (this will install new kernel into grub)
```
####Try to use####
```
git clone https://github.com/qiangpipi/hello_kernel.git
make
insmod ./hello.ko
lsmod |grep hello
rmmod hello
```
####Troubles####
1. While build the kernel tree, you will be asked for some new configuration with Yes or No. If you met some error while compile the kernel, try to No to those new configuration.
2. If you download the different version of the kernel with you current using, make sure to 'make install'. Or u will get error when running insmod like wrong version or different version something.
3. insmod/rmmod will output the string in the shell... Hmm... I guess the shell is the pts/0...
